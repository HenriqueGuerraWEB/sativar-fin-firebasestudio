## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft violet (#B19CD9) to convey a sense of professionalism, combined with approachability and creativity.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0), nearly desaturated violet to maintain a clean and unobtrusive aesthetic.
- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA), a brighter, less saturated analogous color, used for interactive elements, to ensure key elements are noticeable without overwhelming the user interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons, with subtle use of color to indicate status or category. Avoid overly detailed icons.
- Employ a clean and well-organized layout with clear sections for each module. Utilize white space to avoid clutter and improve readability.
- Subtle animations for page transitions and data updates to provide visual feedback without being distracting. Use fades and slides.
